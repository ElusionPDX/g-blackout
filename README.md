# g-blackout




Simple Blackout script inspired from Nopixel. You can change the time after which you want it to work. Feel free to contact for support and bug report.

Features inside script-

Gets triggered after every 10minutes, (you can definitely change the timing to an hour or something)
choose random number to miss or do a blackout (if missed, then there will not be a blackout for that time)
Power cut and automatic restore power after a specific timing which you can change in config.
Note- It is verified on Np Base but should work on every framework. Change the chat message to whatever notification you want.
